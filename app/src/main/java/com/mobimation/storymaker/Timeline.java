 * A Timeline represents the programmatic representation of an editing canvas that determine the layout of
 * one or more Artifacts in start time and duration. The duration of an Artifact can be edited to another
 * beginning and end while on the Timeline.
 * For simplicity Artifacts cannot overlap.
 * The Timeline is not concerned with the graphic presentation or graphic editing of itself
 * but holds the data of the Story represented as pieces of content.
